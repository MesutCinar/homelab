# homelab

This repository contains the files created to spin up the homelab
that is explained in my Youtube series.

I am using a UGREEN NAS DXP2800 with 8 GB RAM for the explanations to keep the 
requirements low. I will switch to WSL on my desktop if more computing power
is needed.

Docker is installable in the UGREEN NAS administration console in the App center.

The intent is to make it easy to follow the setup of the homelab for everyone.

Therefore the series starts by creating a simple core to have something visible
and still useful very fast.

1.) Setting up your homelab core

In the core we will setup the named network "homelab-net" that we will use for
the homelab and a very useful lightweight application named Dozzle to have a 
quick success to begin with.

Dozzle - lightweight live container log monitoring
